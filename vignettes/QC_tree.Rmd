# Introduction

The aim of this package is to [...]

The focus is PennCNV calls, or any other software, given the availability
of the three following global qality scores: BAF drift, LRR SD,
GC Waviness Factor.

This is a graphical representation of a CNV calling pipeline in fixed
genomic loci. The packege implement a filtering step just before visual
inspection.

# Setup

To install and load the latest version of the package you can
run the following code:

```{r setup, eval=F}
devtools::install_github("SinomeM/QCtreeCNV")
library(QCtreeCNV)
```


# Data Format

The pipeline require two main input objects:

1. a `data.frame` (bonus if already `data.table`)
   containing the putative CNV carriers calls;   
1. a `data.frame` (bonus if already `data.table`)
   containing the required quality metrics, it can be
   created using provided functions;   
2. a `data.table` containing CNVRs info, this is computed
   by a package function.

Additionally the package will compute CNVRs (starting from
table 1).

We provide functions to create the quality metrics table
starting from:

a. the raw intensity files;   
b. genomic coordinates of the loci of interest;   
c. a table to link samples ID to the raw intensity files.

Specifications on each object is given in the following sections.
We tried to keep some sort of consistency with PennCNV format when
possible.

## CNV calls

Table 1 consist of the [...]

### Format

| Column Name | Format | Notes |
| :---------- | :----: | :---- |
| sample_ID   | <chr>  | _     |
| locus       | <chr>  | e.g. 22q11.2 |
| chr         | <chr>  | e.g. chr1 |
| start       | <int>  | _     |
| stop        | <int>  | _     |
| type        | <chr>  | "deletion"/"duplication" |
| CNVR_ID     | <chr>  | this columns is added by the package |

## Quality metrics / Raw data trends

Table 2 consist of [...]

### Format

| Column Name  | Format  | Notes |
| :----------  | :----:  | :---- |
| sample_ID    | <chr>   | _     |
| locus        | <chr>   | _     |
| put_carrier  | <logi>  | is the sample a putative carrier for this locus?\* |
| logr1        | <num>   | _     |
| LRRSDlocus   | <num>   | _     |
| BAFc         | <num>   | _     |
| BAFb         | <num>   | _     |
| centDistProp | <num>   | _     |
| overlapProp  | <num>   | _     |
| BAFdrift     | <num>   | _     |
| LRRSD        | <num>   | _     |
| GCWF         | <num>   | _     |

\*: Currently if the table is created using the provided functions
one line is created for each sample/locus combination, even if the
sample is a putative carrier only for one specific locus. Note
however that this is not mandatory, it is for done mostly to reuse
computation time in downstream efficacy measures.

## CNVRs

Table 3 consist of [...]

### Format

| Column name | Format | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| CNVR_ID     | <chr>  | _     |
| chr         | <chr>  | e.g. chr1 |
| start       | <int>  | _     |
| stop        | <int>  | _     |
| freq        | <int>  | _     |


# Run the Pipeline

The package has two main functions:

1. `computeCNVRs()` clusterize CNVs into CNV Regions;   
1. `qctree()` runs the filtering pipeline;

In principle one could also use a different method to create
CNVRs, as long as the output format is compatible to the `QCtreeCNV`
one.

We provide two additional functions to easily create the
quality metrics table, however it can be computed
