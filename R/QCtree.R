## TODO!
# 1. Move here most of the code from exlcudeCNVs.R, all that can be reused
# 2. Integrate additional steps in the pipeline
# 3. Update the suggested values for each step, reflecting the new run in GDK
#    (after initial QC outliers removal)
# 4. Some documentation, keep in mind most of it will live in more discoursive
#    manner in the vignette.
