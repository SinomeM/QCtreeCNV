This is the development repository for the QC filter I am working
on in the context of reducing the human effort in CNV calling. Here
the focus is on calling recurrent CNVs in fixed loci in particular.

The aim is to integrate a much more powerful filter in the pipeline,
before visual inspection, as exemplified in this figure.
